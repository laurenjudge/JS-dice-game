GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds 
- Before starting a game, enter a WINNING SCORE at the bottom
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After this, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold' which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, 
it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the WINNING SCORE points on the GLOBAL score wins the game
